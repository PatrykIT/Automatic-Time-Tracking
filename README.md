# Automatic-Time-Tracking
Inspired by Manic Time application, that is sadly not available on Linux. Keeps time of everything the user was doing during session.

It is aimed for users that want to review their work time, whether they spent it on work stuff, or something else. Thanks to that, user can review his performance, and adjust it if he finds that he has spent too much time not working.

Project is under development, right now working on backend. After whole logic is created and successfully tested, will work on frontend in QT.
